    <p><h2><b>Tumbbad Story</b></h2></p>
      <p>A young boy Vinayak Rao is affected by a personal tragedy.
        His encounter with a wretched old lady who knows of a buried treasure sets him on the path to greed.
      He grows up to explore the local legend of a monster named Hastar and his gold medallions
      Tumbbad is a moody and atmospheric film. Some viewers may find the film a little too deep and disturbing,but fans of Hollywood horror films will be reminded of memorable movies in the genre like Pan’s Labyrinth (2006) and Eraserhead (1977).
      This one is genuinely scary.</p>

      <h1><b>Rocketry: The Nambi Effect Movie Review : Madhavan’s directorial debut soars high slowly but surely</b></h1>

<p><b>Story: </b>Based on the life of one of India’s pioneering rocket scientists Nambi Narayanan,t
  his biography chronicles his achievements,mad passion for the country's space mission,
  his unmatched dedication and the accusation that eventually became the biggest personal and professional setback of his life.</p>
  <p><b>Review: </b>The eventful life of Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) leading scientist and Padma Bhushan awardee Nambi Narayanan is so full of ups and downs that one wonders why it took so long for someone to come up with a full-fledged feature film on him.
  While it was attempted by a few, R Madhavan’s directorial debut that he also wrote and co-produced, finally saw the light of day.
  The film plays out in flashback as Nambi Narayanan (R Madhavan) narrates his life story to superstar Shah Rukh Khan in 2014.
  The crew filming this mammoth interview is cursing their luck for being stuck in the studio late at night for a ‘long and boring’ story of an old scientist.
  However, as Nambi begins talking,
  everyone including the host are riveted to his story.</p>
